# PulseVote â€“ Live Polling Web Application

## What is a Live Polling App?

A **live polling app** is an interactive web platform that allows users to submit votes or feedback in real time. These apps are widely used in classrooms, events, webinars, meetings, and public opinion contexts. Users participate by responding to questions or polls, with results often displayed instantly. Examples include Kahoot, Mentimeter, Slido, Strawpoll, and Google Forms (with live response features).

The main goals of a live polling app are:
- To collect feedback or opinions instantly.
- To boost engagement and participation.
- To provide immediate visual insights from audience input.

## Why Security Matters in Live Polling Apps

**Security is a critical requirement for live polling platforms,** as these apps process sensitive inputs and sometimes personal information. Without adequate security, they are vulnerable to cheating, manipulation, and privacy breaches. For instance, attackers may use bots to submit fake votes, unauthorized users could tamper with results, or user data might be leaked due to improper safeguards.

Real-world cases have shown that insecure polling systems can lead to manipulated results, loss of trust, and privacy violations. For example, online competitions and TV show polls have been compromised by automated scripts, and some platforms have exposed user emails or responses publicly due to weak configurations.

### Reflection

> Security is essential for live polling applications because these systems process user votes or feedback, which can influence outcomes in educational, business, or public contexts. Without strong security, such platforms are vulnerable to threats like vote manipulation (e.g., bots), unauthorized data access, and privacy breaches. These risks can undermine the integrity and trustworthiness of poll results. One common threat is automated bot attacks, where fake votes are submitted to skew results, as seen in several high-profile online competitions and polls. Implementing security measures like authentication, rate limiting, and encryption is crucial to protect the system and its users.

## From Concept to Project: PulseVote

**PulseVote** will be developed as a secure, real-time web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

### Core Features
- Create and manage polls with custom questions.
- Allow users to join and vote in real time.
- Display poll results instantly as votes are received.
- Secure user participation and poll data against common threats.

### Security Objectives
- All data transmission over HTTPS.
- Prevent unauthorized voting and data access.
- Defend against bots and automated attacks (e.g., rate limiting).
- Protect user privacy by securing stored data.

### Project Scope (INSY3D POE Alignment)
- Research and apply best practices in web security.
- Develop a modular, well-documented codebase.
- Reflect on real-world security threats and apply safeguards.
- Demonstrate professional full-stack and security engineering.

**In summary:**  
PulseVote is a real-time polling app designed for reliability and security. By focusing on both usability and robust security, this project aims to meet real-world standards and INSY3D POE requirements.
